The Makefile code you have posted is used in a Buildroot environment for building and installing a custom package. Buildroot is a set of Makefiles and patches that simplifies and automates the process of building a complete Linux system for an embedded system.
Here's an explanation of the individual parts of your Makefile:
- **POLARSTAR_APPS_VERSION := 1.0** sets the version of polarstar_apps to 1.0.
- **POLARSTAR_APPS_SITE = $(TOPDIR)/package/polarstar-apps/** sets the location of the package's source files.
- **POLARSTAR_APPS_SITE_METHOD := local** tells Buildroot that the source files are already at the specified location.
- **POLARSTAR_APPS_BUILD_CMDS** block defines the commands to build the package.
  - **libfixmath** is downloaded from GitHub, unzipped, and any patches are applied.
  - **libfixmath** and **polarstar-apps** are compiled using the TARGET_CC and TARGET_CXX toolchain variables provided by Buildroot.
- **POLARSTAR_APPS_INSTALL_TARGET_CMDS** block defines the commands to install the package.
  - It creates a directory in the target root file system under polarstar-apps.
  - It uses the INSTALL utility to copy the run-model binary to the target directory with specific file permissions (755).
- **$(eval $(generic-package))** is a Buildroot macro that evaluates and executes the instructions provided earlier to build and install the package.

n the compilation lines, (@D) is a Makefile automatic variable that refers to the directory of the target file. TARGET_CC and TARGET_CXX refer to the cross-compile tools for C and C++ respectively.
